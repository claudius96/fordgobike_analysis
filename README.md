## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

##### data wranging steps:
1.The dataset had missing values so I had to remove all rows that had missing values.
2. The dataset had the column for birth year which was represented as a float than as a integer. Because I wanted to work with this column I corrected the column to integer data type.
3. I then droped columns that were not of interest to my analysis.
